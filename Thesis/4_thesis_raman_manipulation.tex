\chapter{Towards Raman manipulation of spin-momentum state components}
\label{chap:raman_manipulation}
%==============================================================================

After the theoretical description of the Raman processes occurring in the diffraction of ultracold atomic ensembles, the following step consists in the generation of momentum and spin states components. The process has a strong resemblance with the previously described, with the added factor that now every momentum state also carries a different internal energy state. This is due to Raman transitions taking place inside the Zeeman levels that erbium's ground state was split into. For the experimental process to function as expected, it is required a given magnetic field $\vec{B}_\text{R} = B_{\text{R}} \vec{e}_x$ along the optical lattice axis $x$. This field will produce the Zeeman splitting of the ground state, and the optical lattice will be in charge of producing the Raman transitions, separating the atomic ensemble into multiple energy levels. However, the Bragg condition must be fulfilled for this process to happen, and now it corresponds with the energy difference between two contiguous Zeeman split states $\Delta E_\text{Ze} = g_J \mu_B B_\text{R}$ \cite{Foot2005}. Due to this, knowing the exact value of $\Delta E_\text{Ze}$ becomes a key factor, and some background magnetic fields  affecting the \ac{bec} can produce values for the Zeeman splitting very different to the expectation. For this reason, a preparatory experiment must be carried out, that allows the estimation of $\Delta E_\text{Ze}$ and helps with the compensation of background fields in favour of the known $\vec{B}_\text{R}$ field.

\section{\Acl{rf} transitions and the Stern-Gerlach experiment}

The objective of this experiment is to quantify the Zeeman splitting induced into an erbium \ac{bec}. As it can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:erbium_scheme}, the energetic ground state of erbium has a total electronic angular momentum of $J = 6$. When the atomic ensemble is being affect by a magnetic field $\vec{B}$, the ground state gets Zeeman split into $2J+1 = 13$ energy states with the secondary quantum number $m_J = \text{-6, -5, ..., +6}$, each one with energy \cite{Foot2005}
\begin{equation}
	E_\text{Ze} = g_J \mu_B m_J B
\end{equation}

Where $g_J$ represents the Land√© g-factor and for this case it is $g_J\approx11/6$. Due to the way in which the experimental set-up is constructed, the \ac{mot}'s \SI{583}{\nano\meter} beam light interacting with erbium in the $z$ axis pushing the atoms against gravity  is $\sigma^-$ polarized \cite{Ulitzsch2016}. Because of this, the beam that interacts mostly with the atomic ensemble forces the atoms to remain the energetic state with $m_J = -6$. This makes the \ac{bec} splitting into orders with respect to energetic differences in the Zeeman levels not directly possible. To allow for transitions between different Zeeman states, the erbium \ac{bec} must interact with a \acf{rf} pulse. Moreover, in order to distinguish the different orders to which the \ac{rf}-pulse has transitioned the atomic ensemble, a Stern-Gerlach experiment must be performed. This consists in the use of a magnetic inhomogeneous field $B_\text{IH}(\vec{r})$ that separates the atomic \ac{bec} spatially according the quantum number $m_J$. The force that allows this is commonly called Stern-Gerlach force and is due to the non-zero gradient applied to the Zeeman term in the hamiltonian \cite{Foot2005}
\begin{equation}
	\vec{F}_\text{SG}(\vec{r}) = \grad{(\vec{\mu}\cdot\vec{B}_\text{IH}(\vec{r}))}
\end{equation}

Where $\vec{\mu}$ represents the atomic magnetic moment. Therefore, for $B_\text{IH}(\vec{r})$ pointing in any arbitrary $z$ direction, the force applied to the different $2J+1$ levels can be obtained as
\begin{equation}
	\vec{F}_\text{SG}(\vec{r}) = - g_J \mu_B m_J \frac{\partial B_\text{IH}(\vec{r})}{\partial z}
\end{equation}

Which is $m_J$ dependant and produces, as a result, different contributions to the energetic states. Due to this, it will be possible to separate the \ac{bec} in different orders, and analyse the internal energetic behaviour of the \ac{bec} after interacting with a given \ac{rf}-pulse. The use of both these tools permits the creation of an experimental set-up that can quantify the energetic difference between contiguous Zeeman orders
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_\text{Ze} = g_J \mu_B B
\end{equation}

For a given homogeneous field $\vec{B}$, interacting initially with the atomic ensemble.
