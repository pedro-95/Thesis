Once the theoretical description of the experiment has been completely introduced, the following part consist in the exposition of the obtained results together with a discussion concerning its correspondence with the announced theory. Due to this, the first step must be the Raman beams characterization with the measurement of each beam radius. This will allow in the next parts to make a direct correlation between beam power and intensity, which will be crucial for the whole experiment characterization.

\section{Measurement of the Raman beams radius}

These laser beams of the \SI{841}{\nano\meter} transition have been considered during all the theory as Gaussian beams. Therefore, they are described spatially by Equation \eqref{eq:intensity_gaussian}, which gives the relation between beam power $P$ and maximum intensity $I_{0}$ as
\begin{equation}
	I_0 = \frac{2P}{\pi w_0^2}
\end{equation}

Where $w_0$ represents the beam radius at the atomic cloud position. Thus, a measurement of this quantity must be performed in order to obtain $I_0$ from the beam power. Figure \ref{fig:raman_beams_radius} shows both horizontal and vertical measurements for the two beams with the use of a knife-edge method. These data points were fit to an error function, which gave the estimations for $w_0$ in every case. From averaging the vertical and horizontal estimations of $w_0$ one gets the final measurement to be
\begin{align*}
	w_{01} &= (0.4961\pm0.0012)\si{\milli\meter}   &   w_{02} &= (0.8778\pm0.0024)\si{\milli\meter}
\end{align*}

Note that the use of 1 and 2 for the Raman beams is also used as a distinction tool in Figure \ref{fig:raman_set_up}. As one can observe, the difference in size between both beams is approximately a factor of 3. This must be compensated by adjusting the beam powers; however, it is a strong mismatch in the parameters that could not be solved due to time constraints. Therefore, the discussion part of the following measurements will have into account this mismatch in beam sizes as a source of possible non-correspondence between theory and experiment.

\section{Characterization of the \SI{841}{\nano\meter} erbium transition with a \ac{bec}}

The following part consists in studying the \SI{841}{\nano\meter} erbium transition by blocking arbitrarily the beam R2 and allowing R1 to interact freely with the erbium \ac{bec}. This way, the Raman beam frequency can be locked in every cycle to a specific value. After an interaction time of 10\si{\milli\second} before the final part of the evaporation phase, the atomic ensemble falls freely during a \ac{tof} of 20\si{\milli\second}. Then, the measurement is taken with the absorption imaging phase. From these measurements, the number of atoms can be estimated and the result, after scanning the frequency of R1, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:resonance_841_transition}. The maximum number of atoms measured is the normalization factor and has the value $N_\text{max} = 34849$. As it can be seen from the image, the plot shows a drop in the atom number when R1 is locked to a wavelength of approximately \SI{840.98827}{\nano\meter} in air. This is because most of the atoms forming a \ac{bec} are resonant at this wavelength get excited by the R1 beam, which expel them out of the ensemble and reduce drastically the atom number. In order to avoid effects like power broadening, the optical power of R1 has been kept as low as possible: $P_{\text{R1}} = (49.0 \pm 0.5) \si{\milli\watt}$. This way, the Gaussian fit performed in Figure \ref{fig:resonance_841_transition} gives an estimation of the resonant wavelength $\lambda_0^*$ and the linewidth broadened mostly due to the beam power $\Delta\nu_{\text{PB}}$ as
\begin{align*}
	\lambda_0^* &= 840.988266(2)\si{\nano\meter}   &   \Delta\nu_{\text{PB}} &= (3600 \pm 1700)\si{\kilo\hertz}
\end{align*}

The result is a quite accurate estimation of $\lambda_0^*$ while the calculation for $\Delta\nu_{\text{PB}}$ is not. The main reason is due to limitations in the scanning precision of the wave-meter, which was locking the laser. In any case, the measurement of $\Delta\nu_{\text{PB}}$ is helpful when comparing it to the theoretical linewidth of the transition $\Delta\nu_0 = \Gamma/2\pi = \SI{7.96}{\kilo\hertz}$ (see Table \ref{tab:Transitions}). Giving a real scenario of how big the one-photon detuning $\delta$ must be to make reasonable the approximations used for the Raman transition processes. On the other hand, the estimation of $\lambda_0^*$ seems to be very precise, but there is a source of errors that has not been considered so far. This is the uncertainty coming from the laser frequency lock, which can not be assumed to remain constant and may shift during measurements. For this reason, the one-photon detuning $\delta$ estimation will be obtained with by using as resonance wavelength in air the following value:
\begin{equation*}
	\lambda_{0} = 840.98827(1)\si{\nano\meter}
\end{equation*}

The interaction between R1 and the atomic ensemble lasts 10\si{\milli\second} before the end of evaporation phase in every experimental cycle. Each measured point has been obtained by averaging the atom number of 5 experimental cycles. }\label{fig:resonance_841_transition}

\section{Diffraction of an erbium \ac{bec} with a 1D-lattice}

Now, it is the moment to study the diffraction of an erbium \ac{bec} with the described Raman lattice set-up. In order to do this, the one photon detuning $\delta$ must be measured. Due to the conclusions made in previous section, the optical frequency of the Raman beams has been chosen for this whole part to be $\lambda_\text{R} = 840.98880(1) \si{\nano\meter}$. Thus, the resulting value for $\delta$ turns out to be
\begin{equation*}
	\delta = 2\pi c\cdot\bigg(\frac{1}{\lambda_{0}} - \frac{1}{\lambda_\text{R}} \bigg) = 2\pi \cdot(225 \pm 6) \si{\mega\hertz}
\end{equation*}

Therefore, the approximations used for the Hamiltonian in Section \ref{subsec:diffraction_regimes} are fulfilled. Because $\delta \gg \Gamma, \Delta\nu_0$ being the decay rate $\Gamma$ and natural linewidth $\Delta\nu_0$ of the \SI{841}{\nano\meter} transition (see Table \ref{tab:Transitions}). Another approximation that has been performed along this thesis results to be $\delta \gg \omega_r = \frac{\Delta_1}{4}$, with the 2-photon recoil frequency $\Delta_1$ given by Equation \eqref{eq:Bragg_condition} with $n=1$. From this expression and the data already shown, one can get the value of $\Delta_1$ to be
\begin{equation*}
	\Delta_1 = 2\pi \cdot (6.713 \pm 0.004)\si{kHz}
\end{equation*}

This result proves the approximation $\delta \gg \Delta_1$ to also be reasonable within the described situation. Therefore, the different theoretical regimes seem to be valid and a more in-depth study is available.

\subsection{Bragg regime}

As seen in Chapter \ref{chap:one_dimensional_lattices}, the Bragg regime is achieved only for long interaction times and when the Bragg condition is being fulfilled. To achieve it, the detuning between Raman beams has been set to $\Delta_1$. The result is an effective two level system between the 0th and +1st diffraction orders acting as ground and excited states respectively. This generates Rabi oscillations for different interaction times $t_\text{int}$ with frequency $\Omega_\text{eff}$ between the ground and excited state population rates, with the last one ideally governed by Equation \ref{eq:population_excited_state}. This effect has been observed for the case of optical power in the Raman beams chosen like: $P_1 = (3.05 \pm 0.05)\si{\milli\watt}$ and $P_2 = (9.10 \pm 0.05)\si{\milli\watt}$. These powers allow to estimate the ``effective'' intensity of the lattice as
\begin{equation*}
	I_\text{eff} = \sqrt{I_1\cdot I_2} = (7.7 \pm 0.4)\si{\kilo\watt\per\meter\squared}
\end{equation*} 

Figure \ref{fig:Bragg_images} shows the effect of Rabi oscillations between the 0th and 1st orders for the exposed value of $I_\text{eff}$. These images are just a small sample of all the measured for this same situation but different values of $t_\text{int}$. From each image, the population rate of any $i$ order with $i \in \{0,1\}$ can be estimated as
\begin{equation}
	P_i = \frac{N_i}{N_0+N_1}
\end{equation}

Where $N_0$ and $N_1$ are the number of atoms in each diffraction order. Therefore, it is possible to measure the population rate in each picture and plot it as a function of $t_\text{int}$. This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Bragg_measurement}.

One can observe the effect of Rabi oscillations due to different $t_\text{int}$ values. The top atomic cloud corresponds to the 0th diffraction order while the bottom cloud is the 1st. This images have been normalized with respect to the maximum minimum value in frame. During the \ac{tof}, gravity pulls the atoms towards right because the camera is rotated 90° counter-clockwise. The effective intensity of the lattice used was $I_\text{eff} = (7.7 \pm 0.4)\si{\kilo\watt\per\meter\squared}$.}

\end{figure}

The plot confirms theory and shows Rabi oscillations in an effective 2-level system as a predominant effect for this regime of parameters. Once this set of data is obtained, one can perform a more in-depth analysis of the oscillations. As it has been said, Equation \ref{eq:population_excited_state} must be fulfilled in this regime for the behaviour of population in the 1st diffracted order $P_1$. This way, a sine squared function fit can be performed to this population rate. However, in order to account for factors like noise or coherent losses in the \ac{bec}, a damped term has been added. Thus, the fitted function expression results
\begin{equation}
	f_\text{fit}(t_\text{int}) = 
\end{equation}
